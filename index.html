        <h2>About the book</h2>
        <p>
          As an educator, Anthony Stanislavski has taught many students over the years and really enjoyed discovering new resources to enhance his teaching. He owns just about every book written on big band drumming and although these are fantastic resources, in general they are a little too advanced for a drummer taking on the style for the first time. So that is why Anthony wrote this book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Beginners Guide to Big Band Drumming sets out; a method for interpreting drum charts, exercises to develop co-ordination and control, and charts to apply the learned skills. The reader will learn how to orchestrate short and long note phrases, how to approach section and ensemble figures, and how to tackle rests and fills. There are also two big band charts written specifically for this book to apply the learned skills.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Each exercise and chart come with four drumless play-along backing tracks, from slow to fast tempos and there are also video and audio demonstrations on all the material covered in the book.
