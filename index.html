        <h2>About the book</h2>
        <p>
          The Beginners Guide to Big Band Drumming sets out; a method for interpreting drum charts, exercises to develop co-ordination and control, and charts to apply the learned skills. The reader will learn how to orchestrate short and long note phrases, how to approach section and ensemble figures, and how to tackle rests and fills. I have also written two big band charts specifically for this book.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each exercise and chart come with 4 drum-less backing tracks, from slow to fast and there are also video demonstrations on all the material covered in the book.
